The Pims Events plugin filters front page content and shows all events and their venues, information fetched from https://api.pims.io/

It also creates shortcode [pims-events] which prints:
    * link to homepage called Home where all events are listed
    * previous and next lists of events
    * list consisting of information about events and venues:
        * Event Name
        * Event date and time in format 'l jS \of F Y \a\t h:i:s A'
        * Event price and currency
        * Venue name, city, and country
        * SOLD OUT message if the event is sold out
    And filters:
        * Number of events per page (Num of events per page)
        * date rage ( From Date - To Date )
        * sort by

    Also if a user is logged in this template will have a save button below every event which when clicked saves that event and its info ( displayed event info + id and venue_id, and displayed venue info + id ) for each user.

Plugin on activation creates three custom tables named:
    * {$wpdb->prefix}pims_events : Which have all displayed event info + event unique id ("id") and "venue_id" which references to unique "id" in venues table
    * {$wpdb->prefix}pims_venues : Which have all displayed venues info + venue unique id ("id")
    * {$wpdb->prefix}pims_user_event : Which is join table between users and events. It has many to many relation between users and events.

Plugin on deactivation deletes all created tables if they exist.
